The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one of them, and make them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Key Components
Strategy Interface: This interface defines a method that all supported algorithms should implement.
Concrete Strategies: These are classes that implement the Strategy interface. Each class encapsulates an algorithm or a specific behavior.
Context: This class is configured with a Concrete Strategy object. It doesn't know about specific strategy implementations, only that it should call the algorithm defined by a strategy.

Benefits of the Strategy Pattern
Open/Closed Principle: You can introduce new strategies without changing the context or other strategies.
Flexibility: You can change strategies at runtime.
Separation of Concerns: The context is not burdened with multiple algorithm implementations.

When to Use
When you have multiple algorithms for a specific task and you want to switch between them easily.
When you want to avoid using conditional statements for selecting and executing different behaviors.
